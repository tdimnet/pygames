# pygames
Collection of games built with Python on my Raspberry Pi.

You can run them on Linux, Mac, and Windows, as long as Python is installed on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python (FYI, I use 3.12).
- [Pygame Zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - You'll need to install it on your machine. At the moment, I didn't find a solution to use on Docker since we'll need Python IDLE. To install Pygame Zero, open a terminal, on Windows, Mac, or Linux, and run the command `pip install pgzero`. This install Pygame and Pygame Zero.


## How to install / How to play?

- All the games are located into specific folders. For example, the Pong clone, called **Boing!**, is located in the `02-boing` folder.
- Open a terminal and cd into it, e.g. `cd 02-boing`.
- Then launch the game by calling the app file with python, e.g. `python app.py`.
- To exit the game, close the game window.
